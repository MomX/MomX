## MomX
 [![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/MomX/MomX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MomX/MomX)
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/MomX)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MomX)

The goal of MomX is to ease utilisation of other MomX packages.

## Installation

### Installation
The (future) released version will be installable from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MomX ) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("Momocs")
```

But I recommend using the development version from GitHub with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MomX/MomX")
```

<!--
### Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
