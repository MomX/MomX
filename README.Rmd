## MomX

MomX is an ecosystem of R packages for everything 2D morphometrics, that is the statistical description of shape and its (co)variation. 

MomX packages share common principles and work together well. This eponymous package is designed to make it easy to install and load core MomX packages in a single step.

Besides MomX itself, these packages are currently in development:

* __[Momocs](http://momx.github.io/Momocs/)__: the mothership of MomX, complete 2D morphometrics toolbox from shapes and collections of shapes. [![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing)

[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/Momocs)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=Momocs)
* __[Momacs](https://github.com/Falindir/Momacs)__: acquisition of morphometrics data
* __[Momecs](https://github.com/MomX/Momecs)__: multivariate analyses for morphometrics data
* __[Momit](https://github.com/MomX/Momit)__: morphometrics data conversion and exchange
* __[Momfarm](https://github.com/MomX/Momfarm)__: breeding shapes

This is (very largely) inspired by the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org)

### Installation
The (future) released version will be installable from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MomX ) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("MomX")
```

But I recommend using the (working) development version from GitHub with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MomX/MomX")
```

Then, all MomX packages (only Momocs so far) will be loadable with a single call to:

```{r attach, eval=TRUE}
library(MomX)
```

and installable/updatable with :
```{r update, eval=FALSE}
MomX_update()
MomX_dev()
```


<!--
### Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
